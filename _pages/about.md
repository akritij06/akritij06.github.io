I am a Research Associate in the Multimodal Content Experience Lab at **Adobe Research**, where I work on improving the efficiency and reliability of generative language models.

My research interests lie in improving the efficiency and reliability of generative language models. This involves exploring their internal mechanisms to optimize inference and develop robust methods for factual grounding and response alignment. I am also interested in techniques for uncertainty quantification and model calibration, particularly in settings that involve complex or multimodal reasoning.

I graduated from **IIT Roorkee** in 2024 with a B.Tech in Electrical Engineering, where I ranked 1st in my department. During my time at Adobe Research, I have published 2 papers at EMNLP 2025, filed 2 patents, and have additional manuscripts under review.

I am currently exploring Masters opportunities for Fall 2026.
